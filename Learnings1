Docker is a platform for developing, shipping, and running applications in containers. 


why docker?

Imagine Docker as a Lunchbox:

Without Docker (Traditional Lunchbox):

Each day, you pack your lunch in a different kind of lunchbox (representing different servers or environments).
Sometimes, your sandwich doesn't fit, or your drink spills because the lunchbox sizes and shapes vary.
It takes time to adjust and make sure everything fits just right.
With Docker (Magic Lunchbox):

You have a magical lunchbox that can hold your sandwich, drink, and snacks all in one neat package.
No matter where you go — school, a friend's house, or a picnic — your lunch always fits perfectly in the same magic lunchbox.
No spills, no adjusting, it just works like magic!
Explanation:

Traditional Lunchbox: Different servers or environments have different requirements (like different-sized lunchboxes), making it tricky to pack and carry your lunch (deploy your app).

Docker (Magic Lunchbox): Docker creates a magical lunchbox (a container) that holds everything your app needs. It fits perfectly everywhere, making it super easy to take your lunch (deploy your app) to school, a friend's house, or a picnic (different servers or environments).

So, Docker is like a magic lunchbox that makes sure your lunch (app) is always ready to go, no matter where you want to enjoy it!
